    /* How can i use quick union to represent an N by N grid? Maybe use a calculation that uses the grid positions:
       pos [0, 4] (assuming we're in bounds) will be represented by the number 5 bc pos[0] * N = 0, then we add
       that to pos[1] + 1 = 5.
       pos [1, 3] is pos[1] * N (let's say N is 5) = 5, then we add pos[1] + 1 = 9
